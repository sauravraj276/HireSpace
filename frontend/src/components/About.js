        Our website focuses on providing an opportunity to the Candidates of our
        university to apply for summer internships. Candidates can create their
        profile and look for the internships provided by several companies and
        apply according to their skills and convenience. They can upload their
        resumes to make it easier for the companies to review at ease. Once
        reviewed, the company can mail the accepted Candidates for further details
        directly, making it an autonomous system. Our team got inspired to
        initiate this after seeing the hardships faced by Candidates to get their
        summer internships as an important milestone in their college life. This
        platform reduces the complexity and time for Candidates to apply for
        internships at one hub. It will also alleviate some difficulties for the
        faculty members. A chatbot is incorporated to help out the first time
        users for better experience.
